Her Ultimate basically means, she makes the game 6v5 for that round, while her Barrier Orb is an amazing tool for both attacking and defending. <br><br>\r\n\r\n4. There are people, who use the term \"healer\" in Valorant. It is safe to say, that these people are wrong, there is no such thing as Healer.

Gain infinite charges of Soul Harvest abilities. Scoring a kill renews the duration. <strong>Cost: 6 ultimate orbs</strong></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"title\">Tips and Tricks</h1>\r\n<p class=\"ability\">1. Despite sharing the same pool of charges, in most (but not all!) cases Devour is much more useful than Dismiss. The heal is extremely rapid and should be used to keep you in the fight so you can snowball as much as possible. <br> <br>\r\n\r\n2. Leer doesn't blind you or your allies - the effect only applies to enemies. <br><br>\r\n\r\n3. Empress increases your firing rate with any weapon by around 33-35%. <br><br>\r\n\r\n4. Reyna is a hard character to play. Someone who is just starting out on Valorant should look for other agents instead. Reyna heavily relies on the player's skill and especially on the player's aim. Reyna players aim for a high kill count to maximize her effectiveness, to be a good fragger, you need a lot of practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe class=\"yt\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzsQNYrq9AM\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n</div>"

Omen can cancel it and return from near certain death or materialize after 4 seconds, able to roam about to his heart’s content. <b>Cost: 7 ultimate orbs</b></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"title\">Tips and Tricks</h1>\r\n<p class=\"ability\">1. Use the teleport abilities to your advantage, you can reach places on the map that other agents can, which means you can have the element of surprise on your side. <br> <br>\r\n\r\n2. There is a neat little trich you can use as Omen. Let's say the spike dropped somewhere, because your teammate died. Most likely the enemy players will watch the bomb carefully. What you can do in this situation is to walk to the site thats the furthest away, use your ult ON the spike, then cancel your ultimate. Now you are on a different site and you have the spike! <br><br>\r\n\r\n3. Keep in mind, that his smoke is like a small dimension. If you are outside the smoke, you don't see what's inside, but if you are inside, you don't see what's outside. So if there is an enemy standing in your smoke, and you walk into it, your enemy will have the upper hand, because he will see your body first. <br><br>\r\n\r\n4. The neat little teleport trick i mentioned above can be countered however. If your enemy stands directly on the spike, your teleportation snatch won't work, so be careful, not to leave this play to the last seconds! </p>\r\n\r\n<iframe class=\"yt\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jJdWy6bDj4\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n</div>"

Right click to curve it right, left to curve it left. It’s an ideal engage tool, but be careful, because it can blind you or your allies if you misfire. <strong>Cost: 250, Max charges: 2</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"ability\"><strong>C - Blaze:</strong> A wall of fire that you can curve as it casts. It obscures vision, damages enemies that walk through/stand on it, and heals you if you’re standing in it. It can be used to block choke points or protect you as you or your allies plant the spike. <strong>Cost: 150, Max charges: 1</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"ability\"><strong>E - Hothands:</strong> Effectively a molotov grenade that also heals you if you stand in its flames and deals AoE damage to enemies within it. Instead of being on a cooldown, this ability refreshes after you get two kills. <strong>Cost: 0, Max charges: 1</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"ability\"><strong>X - Run it Back:</strong> After casting at a location, you have a short amount of time where if you die, you will come back to life and return to where you cast it. Just be sure to cast it from a hidden location as it does take some time for you to resurrect and you’ll be vulnerable to attacks when you return to your body. Lesser known fact is that if you cast the ultimate, you heal back to full health. <strong>Cost: 6 ultimate orbs</strong></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"title\">Tips and Tricks</h1>\r\n<p class=\"ability\">1. It depends on the context, but in some situations you may want to duck into a corner to use your abilities to heal yourself before an engagement. Ideally of course, you’d want to simultaneously heal while using them as utility. <br> <br>\r\n\r\n2. Curveball is great for throwing into alleyways and behind walls, but don’t forget that you can look upwards to curve it onto an enemy that’s above you in a window or on a ledge. <br>\r\n\r\nYou can also throw your Curveball through a Blaze wall to blind an opponent and avoid blinding yourself. <br> <br>\r\n\r\n3. Run it Back is an incredible mix-up tool when used in combination with the teleporters on Bind. You can use it on one side, run through a teleporter and try to get kills at that site. If you’re successful, you can just run through with your resurrected Phoenix and plant, or if it’s heavily fortified, you can just take your death and plant on the side you resurrected on. <br><br>\r\n\r\n4. Run it Back can be the perfect 1v5 tool, don't forget that if you cast your it, you get back all the HP you lost during that round. There are situations, where you get hit in a fight, but in order to clutch the round, you fall back to a corner, where you cast you Ultimate, to go back to the fight, and after it, you are back to full health, essentially you can have 299 health in one round, isn't that cool? With the healing effect of your abilities, its even more.</p>\r\n\r\n<iframe class=\"yt\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttJMFW2wUQM\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n</div>"
